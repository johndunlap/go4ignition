# go4ignition
**_go4ignition_ is NOT a framework.** This must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come from the code
being imparted to you. By design, there are no abstractions between its code and your code, unless you create them
yourself, and there is no update mechanism. If you wish to update, you must run `git pull` and work through
the resulting merge conflicts. It is expected that you fork it, change what you don't like, delete what you don't need,
and add what's missing. Hopefully, this will help you get off the ground faster, similar to a framework,
without incurring the ongoing maintenance costs of a framework. This approach isn't for everyone. Some people prefer
using a framework and that's great. However, if you would prefer to avoid a framework but struggle, as most of us do,
with time constraints then _go4ignition_ might be exactly what you're looking for.
